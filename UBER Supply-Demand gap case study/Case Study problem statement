car unavilability at various times of the day. Naturally this lead to a loss in revenue and company reputation
over a period of time. The company wanted to use the power of Analytics to identify the root cause of this problem and
ultimately get solutions to it.

Aim of Analysis- The aim of analysis was to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) 
and recommend ways to improve the situation. 
As a result of the analysis, we were able to present to the client the root cause(s)
and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.
